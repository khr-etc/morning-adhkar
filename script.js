Ubayy (r.a) asked him, ‘Do all the jinn look like this?’ He said, ‘I know no one among the jinn who is stronger than I.’ Ubayy (r.a) then said, ‘What made you do what you did?’ He said, ‘We heard that you are a man who loves charity, and we wanted to have a portion of your food.’ Ubayy (r.a) asked him, ‘What will protect us from you?’ He said, ‘The verse that is in Al-Baqarah [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255] ‘Allah - there is no true deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence.
